# Project Overview
Provides a single Streamlit page that has multiple dashboards on their own page using data from Xatu using Parquet files. 

## Features
- Top level config that allows me to set things once across the entire app, like the networks supported. 
- A list of dashboards in the sidebar
- Beatiful dashboards with unique insights
- Uses Polars exclusively.
- Each dashboard should define how frequently it refreshes. By default we want to refresh every 3 hours, and support time windows of `-7d`, `-31d`, `-90d`. In local dev mode I should be able to force a refresh.
- Adhere to DRY principles. Create libraries for shared functionality. Important: check if something has been implemented before implementing a shared library.
