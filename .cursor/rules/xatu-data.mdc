# Loading Xatu Data
WHENEVER you need xatu data, lookup how to get/interact with the data from https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ethpandaops/xatu-data/refs/heads/master/llms.txt
Data can be fetched by running a curl. It's HIGHLY recommended that you look up the table schema by running another curl to get the full column types and descriptions to fully understand how to use the data accurately.

## Parquet files
We fetch data from parquet files. When running in local dev modes, we should stop the parquets we download in to `data` (.gitignored) as a thin cache. Production should just load straight from the parquet in memory.
